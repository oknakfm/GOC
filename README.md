# Overview 
This repository provides 10 synthetic orbital action datasets of stars (sibling stars), generated by our numerical simulation that mimics the formation process of the Milky Way. 
Each dataset ("/dataset/seed**.csv") contains 3-dim. orbital action features of 275 stars, associated to each empirical uncertainty set (consisting of 101 features for each). Overall, each dataset contains 275 x 101 = 27775 features with pre-computed penalties. This repository also provides R source codes to reproduce experimental results in a paper of ours [1]. 

While [1] provides a greedy and optimistic approach for clustering (GOC) and applies GOC to the synthetic datasets (whose true clusters are known), [2] further applies GOC to real-world orbital action datasets of stars. See [1] and [2] for further details of these datasets and experimental results.

# Repository Descriptions

## <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/tree/main/dataset">/dataset</a>
You can find 10 datasets "seed1.csv"-"seed10.csv". 
See [xxxx] for more detailed descriptions of the dataset generation and [1] for more detailed description of these datasets. 
Also the preprocessed instances (standardadization + removal of some outliers) can be found: they were preprocessed by <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/blob/main/verbose/preprocessing.R">"/verbose/preprocessing.R"</a>. 
In <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/tree/main/dataset/verbose">"/dataset/verbose"</a>, you can find intermediate products of our numerical simulation (to generate the synthetic datasets). 

## <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/blob/main/visualization.R">visualization.R</a>
This script provides visualizations of datasets, and clustering results. The visualization results are saved to <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/tree/main/output/visualization">"/output/visualization"</a>.

## <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/blob/main/experiments.R">experiments.R</a>
This script applies GOC to our synthetic datasets. The clustering results are saved to <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/tree/main/output">"/output"</a>.
