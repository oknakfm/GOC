# Overview 
This repository provides 10 synthetic orbital action datasets of stars (sibling stars), generated by our numerical simulation that mimics the formation process of the Milky Way. 
Each dataset ("/dataset/seed**.csv") contains pre-processed 3-dim. orbital action features of 275 stars, associated to each empirical uncertainty set (consisting of 101 feature instances for each). Overall, each dataset contains 275 [stars] x 101 [feature instances in each uncertainty set / each star] = 27775 [feature instances] associated with pre-computed penalties. This repository also provides R source codes to reproduce experimental results in our paper [1]. 

While [1] provides a greedy and optimistic approach to clustering (GOC) and applies GOC to the synthetic datasets (whose true clusters are known), [2] further applies GOC to real-world orbital action datasets of stars. Please see [1] for further details of these synthetic datasets and experimental results.

# Repository Descriptions

## <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/tree/main/dataset">/dataset</a>
You can find 10 datasets "seed1.csv"-"seed10.csv". See [1] (Example 1 in Section 2 and Appendix A) for more detailed description of these datasets. The standardized instances (including removal of a few outliers) can be found: they were processed by <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/blob/main/verbose/preprocessing.R">"/verbose/preprocessing.R"</a>. In <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/tree/main/dataset/verbose">"/dataset/verbose"</a>, you can find intermediate products of our numerical simulation (to generate the synthetic datasets). 

## <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/blob/main/visualization.R">visualization.R</a>
This script provides visualizations of datasets, and clustering results. The visualization results are saved to <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/tree/main/output/visualization">"/output/visualization"</a>.

## <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/blob/main/experiments.R">experiments.R</a>
This script applies GOC to our synthetic datasets. The clustering results are saved to <a href="https://github.com/oknakfm/GOC/tree/main/output">"/output"</a>.
